		In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs: check folio mapping

		again. In particular, if we are relocating concurrently with aborting a transaction, this can

	Vulnerability description:
		In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs: fix use-after-free when 
		COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we 
		have the tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled 
		(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent buffer while inside the 
		tracepoint code. This is because in some paths that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as 
		btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so 
		btrfs_force_cow_block() drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls 
		free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent buffer with RCU. This 
		means that if we are on a kernel with preemption, the current task may be preempted before calling 
		trace_btrfs_cow_block() and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block() 
		is called, resulting in a use-after-free. Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from 
		btrfs_cow_block() to btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed. This also has 
		a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), 
		since btrfs_force_cow_block() is called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.

	Vulnerability description:
		In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PCI/MSI: Handle lack of 
		irqdomain gracefully Alexandre observed a warning emitted from pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs() on a RISCV 
		platform which does not provide PCI/MSI support: WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at 
		drivers/pci/msi/msi.h:121 pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs+0x2c/0x32 __pci_enable_msix_range+0x30c/0x596 
		pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs+0x2c/0x32 pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity+0xb8/0xe2 RISCV uses hierarchical 
		interrupt domains and correctly does not implement the legacy fallback. The warning triggers from 
		the legacy fallback stub. That warning is bogus as the PCI/MSI layer knows whether a PCI/MSI parent 
		domain is associated with the device or not. There is a check for MSI-X, which has a legacy 
		assumption. But that legacy fallback assumption is only valid when legacy support is enabled, but 
		otherwise the check should simply return -ENOTSUPP. Loongarch tripped over the same problem and 
		blindly enabled legacy support without implementing the legacy fallbacks. There are weak 
		implementations which return an error, so the problem was papered over. Correct 
		pci_msi_domain_supports() to evaluate the legacy mode and add the missing supported check into the 
		MSI enable path to complete it.

	Vulnerability description:
		In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fred: Clear WFE in 
		missing-ENDBRANCH #CPs An indirect branch instruction sets the CPU indirect branch tracker (IBT) 
		into WAIT_FOR_ENDBRANCH (WFE) state and WFE stays asserted across the instruction boundary. When 
		the decoder finds an inappropriate instruction while WFE is set ENDBR, the CPU raises a #CP fault. 
		For the "kernel IBT no ENDBR" selftest where #CPs are deliberately triggered, the WFE state of the 
		interrupted context needs to be cleared to let execution continue. Otherwise when the CPU resumes 
		from the instruction that just caused the previous #CP, another missing-ENDBRANCH #CP is raised and 
		the CPU enters a dead loop. This is not a problem with IDT because it doesn't preserve WFE and IRET 
		doesn't set WFE. But FRED provides space on the entry stack (in an expanded CS area) to save and 
		restore the WFE state, thus the WFE state is no longer clobbered, so software must clear it. Clear 
		WFE to avoid dead looping in ibt_clear_fred_wfe() and the !ibt_fatal code path when execution is 
		allowed to continue. Clobbering WFE in any other circumstance is a security-relevant bug. [

		In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ublk: detach gendisk from ublk 
		device if add_disk() fails Inside ublk_abort_requests(), gendisk is grabbed for aborting all 
		inflight requests. And ublk_abort_requests() is called when exiting the uring context or handling 
		timeout. If add_disk() fails, the gendisk may have been freed when calling ublk_abort_requests(), 
		so use-after-free can be caused when getting disk's reference in ublk_abort_requests(). Fixes the 
		bug by detaching gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails.

		go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. An argument injection

		happens when the file transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol that shells 
		out to git binaries. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.13.0.

	Vulnerability description:
		go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. A denial of service 
		(DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an 
		attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git 
		server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users running versions of go-git from 
		v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability.

		The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of the "next" parameter, which is included in the 
		application's response without adequate escaping. An attacker can exploit this flaw by tricking a 
		user into visiting a specially crafted URL, causing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in 
		the context of the victim's browser. The issue occurs even though the application has sanitization 
		mechanisms in place.

	Vulnerability description:
		File Upload vulnerability in ChestnutCMS through 1.5.0. Based on the code analysis, it was 
		determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string 
		is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service, 
		the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example, given a string like: 
		data:image/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after 
		the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th 
		character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable 
		(representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However, the file 
		extension is not validated, and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend, it poses 
		significant security risks.

	Vulnerability description:

		mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from 
		executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.
